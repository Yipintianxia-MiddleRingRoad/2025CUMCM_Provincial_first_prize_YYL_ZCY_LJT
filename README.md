# 2025年大学生数学建模竞赛A题（四川省一等奖）参赛总结与资源分享
非常感谢您能阅读至此！这份材料整理自2025年大学生数学建模竞赛（四川省一等奖）的参赛总结，包含参赛论文、AI工具使用说明的LaTeX文件压缩包（可直接导入Overleaf实现三人在线协作编辑）及其他实用资料，在此统一分享给各位同学。

我的数学建模之路不算顺遂，前后历经两年：第一年参赛不仅颗粒无收，还因未能处理好与一位队友的关系而饱受困扰，那段时间甚至陷入了半年的自我怀疑——学业、家庭与情感上的压力也接连袭来，一度让我很受挫。但我始终没敢认输，更没选择放弃。这一年里，我重新审视自身不足，陆续报名了蓝桥杯、服务外包大赛、计算机设计大赛及各类数学建模小型赛事。最终的收获远不止几个奖项，更重要的是彻底找回了自信：不再像从前那样，连找队友时都因“简历空白”而底气不足。

此前我的数学建模论文成绩一直平平，直到2025年暑假的三次集中训练，才实现了水平的显著提升——期间我们改用Overleaf在线协作编辑，积累了不少高效协作的经验。关于本次论文使用的LaTeX模板，有几点说明：最初我们在https://cn.overleaf.com/latex/templates 网站搜索“数学建模国赛”时，偶然发现了一款简约美观的模板（可惜目前该模板已无法找到，原作者信息也未能追溯）。这款原模板的字体设计与附录排版非常出色，但存在行距过宽的问题；加之今年竞赛新增了“AI工具使用说明”的要求，我们在原模板基础上调整了参数、整理了引用库，让代码更规整，也更贴合国赛规范。

现经另外两位队友一致同意，将我们的参赛论文无偿分享，供大家参考学习；分享包中还包含几份我们过往参赛积累的实用文件，希望能为大家提供更多帮助。

关于数学建模的学习方法，网上已有大量教程，此处不再展开；但特别推荐“数模加油站”及清风老师的课程——建议大家多关注“干货”内容，避免浪费时间在“水课”上。

最后，希望这份分享能切实帮到正在准备数模竞赛的你。若内容中存在疏漏，欢迎大家指出；若涉及侵权，请随时联系我们删除。再次感谢您的阅读！

2025 Mathematical Modeling Competition for College Students (First prize in Sichuan Province) Competition summary and resource sharing
Thank you so much for reading this far! This material is a summary of the entries from the Mathematical Modeling Competition for College Students in 2025 (the first prize of Sichuan Province). It contains the LaTeX file compression package of the entries, the instructions for the use of AI tools (which can be directly imported into Overleaf to realize online collaborative editing by three people) and other practical information, which is shared with all students.

My path to mathematical modeling took two years: not only did I fail in my first year, but I was troubled by my failure to manage a relationship with a teammate, and I even had half a year of self-doubt during that time. The pressures of school, family, and emotion also hit me hard. But I never dare to concede defeat, but did not choose to give up. In this year, I re-examined my own shortcomings and successively signed up for the Blue Bridge Cup, Service outsourcing competition, computer design competition and various small competitions of mathematical modeling. The final harvest is far more than a few awards, more important is the complete return of self-confidence: no longer like before, even when looking for teammates because of "resume blank" and lack of confidence.

My performance in mathematical modeling papers had been flat until three intensive trainings in the summer of 2025, during which time we switched to Overleaf online collaborative editing and accumulated a lot of experience in efficient collaboration. A few notes on the LaTeX templates used in this paper: Initially we search on the https://cn.overleaf.com/latex/templates website "mathematical modeling", stumbled upon a simple and beautiful template (it's a pity that at present the template has been unable to find, also failed to trace the author information). The font design and appendix layout of this original template are excellent, but the line spacing is too wide. In addition, this year's competition added the "AI tool instructions" requirements, we adjusted the parameters on the basis of the original template, tidy up the reference library, make the code more regular, but also more in line with the national competition specifications.

Now, with the unanimous agreement of the other two teammates, we will share our competition papers free of charge for your reference and study. The sharing package also contains several useful documents accumulated from our past competitions, hoping to provide you with more help.

There are a number of online tutorials on how to learn mathematical modeling, which will not be covered here. But especially recommend "Model Gas station" and teacher Qingfeng courses - we suggest that you pay more attention to "dry goods" content, avoid wasting time in "water lessons".

Finally, I hope this sharing can really help you who are preparing for the mathematical model competition. If there are omissions in the content, welcome to point out; If infringement is involved, please feel free to contact us to delete. Thanks again for reading!
